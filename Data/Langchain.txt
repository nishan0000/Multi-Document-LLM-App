Here is a complete architecture for an LLM-based application using Python, LangChain, and YouTube transcripts for Q&A:

**Memory:**

* **Conversation Window Memory:** This memory will store the most recent transcripts and Q&A interactions. This will allow the LLM to keep track of the context of the conversation and provide more relevant answers.
* **Buffer Memory:** This memory will store all of the YouTube transcripts that have been processed by the LLM. This will allow the LLM to quickly access transcripts when needed, without having to reprocess them.

**Retriever:**

* **Embedding Retriever:** This retriever will embed the transcripts and Q&A interactions into a high-dimensional space. This will allow the LLM to efficiently search for similar transcripts and answers.
* **Semantic Retriever:** This retriever will use a semantic similarity metric to find similar transcripts and answers. This will allow the LLM to find answers that are relevant to the context of the conversation, even if they are not exact matches.

**Vectorstore:**

* **FAISS:** FAISS is a fast library for approximate nearest neighbor search. It is a good choice for vectorstore because it is efficient and scalable.
* **Annoy:** Annoy is another fast library for approximate nearest neighbor search. It is a good choice for vectorstore if you need a more lightweight option.

**Overall Architecture:**

The following is a high-level overview of the overall architecture of the application:

1. The user asks a question.
2. The LLM uses the retriever to find similar transcripts and answers.
3. The LLM uses the conversation window memory to keep track of the context of the conversation.
4. The LLM generates an answer based on the similar transcripts and answers, as well as the context of the conversation.
5. The answer is returned to the user.

**Implementation:**

The application can be implemented using the following Python libraries:

* **LangChain:** LangChain is a library for building and deploying LLMs.
* **FAISS:** FAISS is a library for approximate nearest neighbor search.
* **Annoy:** Annoy is a library for approximate nearest neighbor search.
* **Transformers:** Transformers is a library for natural language processing.
* **PyTorch:** PyTorch is a library for machine learning.

The following is a high-level overview of the implementation steps:

1. Preprocess the YouTube transcripts by cleaning them and converting them to a standard format.
2. Train an LLM on the preprocessed transcripts.
3. Build a retriever by embedding the transcripts into a high-dimensional space.
4. Implement the conversation window memory and buffer memory.
5. Implement the Q&A functionality by using the LLM to generate answers based on the retriever's results and the conversation window memory.

Once the application is implemented, it can be deployed as a web service or a command-line tool.
